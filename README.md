# GigaPet User Interface

This is the user interface portion for the build weeks Gigapet project for Lambda School. In this project we have created a multi-page marketing website for the app Gigapet. We have a landing page with mock up designs to introduce the product and get users to sign up. A second about page shows off the team and explains a little about them. On the website we demo different utilizations of javascripts to showcase components, objects, animations, and carousels.
